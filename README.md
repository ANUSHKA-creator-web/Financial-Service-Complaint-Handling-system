# Product Complaint Classification with Bi-LSTM
This project develops an automated system for classifying and routing financial complaints by analyzing their text content using natural language processing and machine learning methods.



## üìå Project Overview

* Dataset: **162,421 complaints** across **5 financial products**.
* Primary Model: **Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)** for text classification.
* Benchmarks: Bag-of-Words, n-grams, TF-IDF + Naive Bayes.
* Imbalance Handling: Random undersampling to improve fairness and accuracy.
* Full **text preprocessing pipeline** for cleaning real-world complaint data.
